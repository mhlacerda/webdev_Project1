			<p>It was 2012, the weather was starting to get colder and I decided to knitting again, since every winter I did it, but never finished anything.</p>
			<p>But this time it was different, suddenly, I realized that knitting became a passion, it turned into something I wanted to do forever</p>
			<p>I knew the basics of the basics, what purl stitch and knit stitch were.</p>
			<p>I then started researching everything about knitting on the internet, and with that I started discovering new techniques, new stitches, and I fell more and more in love with the craft.</p>
			<p>I created the brand <em>damanu</em> to show my work. My pieces are handmade, one by one, in an exclusive way.</p>
			<p>Little by little I weave the threads and colors, creating pieces and being happy!</p>
